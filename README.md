Chrome extension that adds UI to Jira Cloud next-gen projects that helps working with estimates

## Why

At my work we use Jira and scrum. Every task is given an estimate which we use to create a report on how the work is going. I was tired of manually calculating the sums of the estimates, how much is done and how much is left to do in our epics.

Therefore I made this extension that simplifies the task. Enjoy!
