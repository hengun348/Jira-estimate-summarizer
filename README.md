# Jira-estimate-summarizer
Chrome extension that shows estimate summaries and percentage done (based on estimates) in the epics details in Jira cloud next-gen projects.

## Why

At my work we use Jira and scrum. Every task is given an estimate which we use to create a report on how the work is going. For some reason the summaries of estimates are only shown in the backlog in Jira cloud next-gen projects and not in epics. In epics you can see a summary based on numbers of tasks but this is less accurate since tasks takes different amount of time to complete. I was tired of manually calculating the sums of the estimates manually.

This extension adds the same summary for epic details so you can get a much more accurate overview of how the work is going.
